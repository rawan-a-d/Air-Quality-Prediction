# Air-Quality-Prediction

This AI can predict air quality within an area on a daily and weekly basis. With these predictions, areas are classified from Good to Hazardous which the policy makers can use to take appropriate actions.
The goal is to spread awareness about local air pollution to policy makers, so they can:

1. Analyze what areas are highly polluted and attempt to improve air quality in these areas.
2. Decide whether to give permission for certain activities.

A simple-to-use tool is built to visulaize the predictions of the models ([Air Quality Prediction Web-App](https://github.com/rawan-a-d/Air-Quality-Prediction-WebApp)).
